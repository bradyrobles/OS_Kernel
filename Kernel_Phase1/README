UNFINISHED PROJECT

This project is not complete and is barely able to post.  I ran into
a lot of difficulty with maintaining the correct variables, evident in 
the PID of quit processes.  For some reason, it kept maxing out at 12,000
and no matter what I did, I couldn't get it to stop.  I believe it may have
something to do with the garbage collection and not properly freeing my
structs but I'm not really sure. 

A lot of the simple test cases like 00 also do not even post.  After running 
through the debugger, it appeared that when I was disabling interrupts, calls
to console were throwing BAD_ACCESS_CODES. For this reason, I didn't include
an enumerated report of each test case because I don't think I pass any of them
anyway.  

Overall I did pretty awful on this project and hope I can do a lot better on the following
programs.  I am wondering if I would be able to get a different partner for the next 
project.  John and I were in communication in the first week of this project until he 
went radio silent.  None of the code submitted was written by John.
